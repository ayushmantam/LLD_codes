This image represents an example of **composition in C++** using **pointers**. Let's break it down step-by-step to understand what‚Äôs happening:

---

### üß± **Code Structure (Simplified):**

#### 1. **Class A**

```cpp
class A {
    void method1();
};
```

Class `A` has a method called `method1()`.

---

#### 2. **Class B**

```cpp
class B {
    A* a;

    B() {
        a = new A();
    }

    void method2();
};
```

* `B` **contains a pointer** to an object of class `A`.
* In the constructor of `B`, memory for `A` is dynamically allocated (`a = new A();`).
* So, **class `B` "has-a" class `A`**, which is a form of **composition**.

---

#### 3. **main() function**

```cpp
int main() {
    B* b = new B();        // Create an object of class B
    b->method2();          // Call B's method

    b->a->method1();       // Access class A's method through B's object
}
```

### üß† **Concepts Represented:**

| Concept                       | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Composition**               | Class `B` contains a pointer to an instance of `A` (has-a relationship)                 |
| **Dynamic Allocation**        | `new A()` is used inside the constructor of `B` to allocate `A`                         |
| **Accessing Composed Object** | You can access `A`'s method from `B`'s pointer: `b->a->method1()`                       |
| **Pointer-Based Composition** | This version uses pointers, unlike earlier value-based composition (stronger ownership) |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

This example is technically **composition**, but since it uses `new`, it:

* requires manual `delete` to prevent memory leaks.
* behaves more like **aggregation** unless managed carefully (e.g., smart pointers, destructors).

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation:

To make this **pure composition**, you'd ideally use:

```cpp
class B {
    A a;  // direct member object, not pointer
};
```

But the pointer version is still valid if you need **dynamic behavior or late binding**.

Let me know if you want this rewritten using `smart pointers` or converted into UML diagram!
